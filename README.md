# hello-world
This repository is for practicing GitHub Flow
My name is Mike, and I am new to programming, I'm currently learning Python, SQL, java, R and excel. I am really enjoying the journey, although I have found it difficult so far as I have been doing everything alone without any mentors or peers to guide me through my learning journey. I hope to be able to code independently within the next 12 months, as I always need to copy code directly from other platforms at the moment, Any help or advice will be most welcome. My main goal is to break into the world of data analytics and data science, as I love Physics and mathematics, and hope to use those skille during my time learning to code
